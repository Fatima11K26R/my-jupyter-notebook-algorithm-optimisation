    "# Modeling a multi-beam mask writer (MBMW)\n",

    "# This example outlines a simplified model of a multi-beam mask writer using mathematical programming. \n",
    "#By considering parameters like the number of beams, writing speed, defect rates, and constraints related to data transfer\n",
    "#and coverage, this model can be extended further based on specific requirements and characteristics of the actual writing\n",
    "#process. More complex scenarios may involve advanced techniques such as metaheuristics, simulations, or machine learning\n",

    "Modeling a multi-beam mask writer (MBMW) involves creating a mathematical framework that captures the dynamics and functionalities of the system used in photolithography for semiconductor fabrication. A multi-beam mask writer utilizes multiple beams of electrons or photons to write patterns onto a substrate, typically a silicon wafer, in a parallel fashion to improve throughput and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: Design data (layout of the integrated circuit).\n",
    "    Output: Patterned mask or directly patterned substrate.\n",
    "    Processes: Beam generation, pattern writing, error correction, and feedback mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Beam Count: Nb: Number of writing beams.\n",
    "    - Writing Speed: v: Speed of the writing process (e.g., in mm/s).\n",

    "Let x_ij: A binary decision variable indicating whether beam i writes to pixel j.\n",
    "** Objective Function\n",
    "The objective function can be formulated to minimize the total writing time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize T_total = (S / (N_b * v)) + Σ (t_e * x_ij) + Σ (d * x_ij)\n",
    "Where M is the total number of pixels in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints\n",
    "1. Writing Capacity:\n",
    "Σ (x_ij) <= 1  for all j (each pixel can only be written by one beam)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each beam should not exceed its maximum writing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Transfer Rate:\n",
    "(S / v) <= R_d  Where R_d is the data transfer rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the writing speed does not exceed the data transfer capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Defect Constraints:\n",
    "Σ (d * x_ij) <= Defect Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected defect rate must remain below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Coverage:\n",
