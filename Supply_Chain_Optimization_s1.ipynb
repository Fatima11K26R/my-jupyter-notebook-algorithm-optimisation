    "### Supply chain \n",
    "A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in producing and delivering a product or service from the supplier to the customer. It includes sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, storage, distribution, and final delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example:\n",
    "Consider the supply chain for a smartphone:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raw Material Suppliers**: Provide components like lithium for batteries and silicon for chips.\n",
    "2. **Manufacturing**: Factories assemble the phones.\n",
    "3. **Distribution**: Logistics firms ship phones to warehouses or retailers.\n",
    "4. **Retail/Online**: Customers purchase the smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step ensures the product reaches the customer efficiently.\n",
    "You can consider the entire process—from creating to buying a product—as a supply chain. Each step, such as sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, storage, transportation, distribution, and sales, represents a part of the supply chain procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creation**: Sourcing components for a car (like steel or electronics).\n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: Assembling the car at a factory.\n",
    "- **Distribution**: Shipping cars to dealerships.\n",
    "- **Buying**: Customers purchasing cars from dealerships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these interconnected steps form the complete supply chain.\n",
    "The supply chain encompasses the entire process of delivering a product or service, from sourcing raw materials to final delivery to the customer. It includes activities like procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and distribution.\n",
    "Manufacturing is just one component of the supply chain, focused on transforming raw materials into finished goods.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supply Chain**: Covers raw material sourcing, transportation, assembly, warehousing, and customer delivery.\n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: Specifically involves the production or assembly of goods within the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supply chain is broader, while manufacturing is one of its essential steps.\n",
    "The concept of a supply chain applies to services, including software development, though it's used more commonly in physical production. In services, the supply chain involves the processes, resources, and steps needed to deliver the service efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Software Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sourcing**: Gathering tools, APIs, or libraries needed for development.\n",
    "2. **Development**: Writing and testing code.\n",
    "3. **Deployment**: Delivering the software to end-users or clients.\n",
    "4. **Maintenance**: Providing updates and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "While traditionally associated with factories, the supply chain concept is adaptable to any workflow that involves inputs, transformation, and outputs.\n",
    "\n",

    "- $X_{ij}$: Decision variable, representing units shipped.  \n",

    "- $X_{13} + X_{23} \\geq 50$ (Customer 3 demand)\n",

    "Solve using a linear programming solver.  \n",
    "After solving, you get values for $X_{ij}$, which indicate the optimal quantity to ship from each supplier to each customer, minimizing costs while meeting constraints.\n"
